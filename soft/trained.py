The airline Voepass confirmed in a statement that a plane headed for Sao Paulo's international airport Guarulhos crashed in the city of Vinhedo with 58 passengers and four crew members aboard. The statement didn't say what caused the accident. City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors. Only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged, while none of the residents were hurt. At an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained."
